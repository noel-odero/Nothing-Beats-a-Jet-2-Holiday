    summary:
      "From struggling to find work to leading major infrastructure projects. Carlos shows how dedication and continuous learning can transform your career.",
    fullStory: `
      When Carlos graduated from the TVET Welding Technology program in 2020, the job market was challenging due to the pandemic. Despite having solid technical skills, he struggled to find his first job for several months.

      "I was starting to doubt myself," Carlos recalls. "But my instructors always told us that persistence and continuous learning were key to success in this field."

      His breakthrough came when he accepted an entry-level position at a small fabrication shop, even though the pay was lower than he hoped. Carlos used this opportunity to perfect his skills and learn about different welding techniques.

      Within six months, his dedication caught the attention of Bridge Construction Inc, a major infrastructure company. They offered him a position as a junior welder on their team.

      "The transition to infrastructure work was challenging," Carlos explains. "Bridge welding requires precision and adherence to strict safety standards. But the TVET program had prepared me well for this."

      Carlos quickly proved himself on various projects, from highway overpasses to pedestrian bridges. His attention to detail and leadership qualities didn't go unnoticed.

      After two years, he was promoted to Senior Welder, and just last year, he became Lead Welder on a $2 million bridge project connecting two major districts in the city.

      "Today, I lead a team of 8 welders, and we're responsible for some of the most critical welds on major infrastructure projects. The skills I learned at TVET were just the beginning â€“ the real growth came from never stopping to learn and improve."

      Carlos's advice to current students: "Don't be discouraged by initial setbacks. Every challenge is an opportunity to grow. The technical skills you learn are important, but developing leadership and problem-solving abilities will set you apart."
